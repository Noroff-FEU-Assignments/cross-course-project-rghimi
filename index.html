    <p>Following points will be heightlighted</p>

    <p>Sanitization of data:
       ensuring that the data a system accepts is in the right format. This    can be        done manually or by using a well-known third-party solution. For example, in NodeJS, you have the        sanitize-html package for sanitizing HTML code, and it is downloaded over a million times per        week. There is also an ORM(Object Related Mapping) library for sanitizing the SQL related code.
