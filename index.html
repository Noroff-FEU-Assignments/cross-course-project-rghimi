    <h1>Hello Secured World Wide Web</h1>

    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks?
    </p>
    <p>
      My first advise to the potential client would be to follow all major
      web-security practices taken in front end development, inorder to protect
      all shorts of information on world wide web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major securtity threats such as cross-site scripting,sql
      injection,cross-site request forgey can be avoid following belows:

    <p>
      Sanitization of data: <br />
      Ensuring that the data system accepts is in the right format. This can be
      done manually or by using a well-known third-party solution. For example,
      in NodeJS, you have the sanitize-html package for sanitizing HTML code,
      and it is downloaded over a million times per week. There is also an
      ORM(Object Related Mapping) library for sanitizing the SQL related code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure authorization and authentication: <br />
      ÃŸ This involves ensuring that authorization and authentication are hard to
      crack. This can be done manually but can be best achieved by using an
      open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin, Okta,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make use of a well-known third-party application: <br />
      This involves ensuring that a third-party application is trusted and
      tested. One might need to carry out some research about the application
      before it can be used. An easier way to do that is to check how many
      downloads the application gets per week.

      Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD) Continuous
      Deployment/Continuous Integration is an automatic process of integrating
      and delivering code to production. Usually, CI/CD runs every change
      against some security checks and decides the delivery of the change to
      productions. Any change that does not pass the checks would be rejected
      and flagged for a rework. It basically catches oversights from developers
      and helps maintain the reliability of the changes coming to a codebase.

      Network security A network is the connection of nodes via wired or
      wireless means in order to share data across nodes. Network security is
      the act of protecting the exchange of packets of data across the network.
      A network engineer is the one responsible for network security. However, a
      front-end developer must be wary of what network to connect to as well as
      where to host the website. Data could be compromised via the hosting
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementation of automatic user timeout This involves protecting users
      who have left their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time. In
      most cases, this would be done by the backend team by setting a session
      for the expiration of the user credentials. However, as a front-end
      developer, you have to ensure that the API you are consuming has put this
      into consideration.
